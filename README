BinGeR: in-situ Genome recovery tool for series metagenomes

BinGeR (Binner for Genome Recovery) is a platform for de novo genome recovery from series metagenomes. It integrates information from single copy gene content, contig coverage correlation, and contig oligo-nucleotide composition correlation, and contig alignments to bin genome fragments together. It is written in Python, therefore it should run on Windows, Mac OS, and Unix/Linux.

[How to install]
==========================
Dependencies:

Python >= 2.6
BLAT 

Python libraries:

NetworkX >= 1.7 
Pysam >= 0.6
Numpy >= 1.5.1
Scipy >= 0.12.0
BioPython >= 1.58
scikit-learn >= 0.14

Packages with older versions might work, but not tested. You can certainly manually install all of the packages, however, I recommend using Anaconda, which is a Python distribution for big data processing, it bundles many packages for data scientists. For more information, go to:

https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/

Anaconda includes all the dependencies to run BinGeR.

To install, unzip/untar/uncompress the BinGeR package, and in terminal cd to the unpacked directory, and run:

$ python setup.py install

You can alway supply --prefix to alter the installation directory:

$ python setup.py install --prefix = user/defined/installation/directory

If you have everything ready, this should take care of the installation.

[How to run BinGeR]
==========================
After running setup.py, you may want to either open a new tab in the terminal, or in current terminal tab:
$ source ~/.profile

In terminal, as simple as:
$ BinGeR.py -l <sample.txt> -o <output_dir> [options]

For more detailed settings, please type:

$ BinGeR.py --help

This should print out a detailed settings for you.

Note: to start with a project, you will need to use the scripts in the utils directory to produce the files first

[How to construct a project]
===============================


[Contents of db folder]
==========================
In db/, you will find a few db files:
HMM.txt
ncbiNodes.lib
ncbiSciNames.lib
singleCopy.prot.tar.gz

[Contents of utils folder]
==========================
In utils/, you will see a few Python scripts, as listed below:

bamCoverage.py
oligoNtZScore.py
runHMMScan.py
interleaveReads.py

They are utility scripts that will assist you in preparing the input files necessary for BinGeR.

For detailed usage of each utils script, please run:

$ utils/script --help
